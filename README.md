Hi there! 游녦

i'm Ozer0x777, and I am a CERT Engineer. I have been working with computers since I was 8 years old, and I have always had a passion for cybersecurity.
About Me

As a cybersecurity professional, I am constantly learning and exploring new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I started my journey with "hacker'z voice" magazine, and I have been hooked ever since.

I am passionate about forensic investigations and helping others in the cybersecurity community. That's why I have created this GitHub account to share my scripts and tools that can assist others in forensic investigations.
Projects


## Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

   #### [VirusTotal API Scanner:](https://github.com/Ozer0x777/Jiaolong_Malware_Analysis) This repository contains a script that utilizes the VirusTotal API to scan files for malware.

It accepts multiple inputs and generates a CSV report containing the results.
