About Me

As a cybersecurity professional, I am constantly learning and exploring new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I started my journey with "hacker'z voice" magazine, and I have been hooked ever since.

I am passionate about forensic investigations and helping others in the cybersecurity community. That's why I have created this GitHub account to share my scripts and tools that can assist others in forensic investigations.
